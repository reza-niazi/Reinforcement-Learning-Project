# Reinforcement-Learning-Project
This was a partnered project that was done in a Machine Learning course over reinforcement learning. In this project, we used Gym's OpenAI Lunar Lander Enviornment. 
The environment simulates an agent (spacecraft) trying to land on the surface of the moon. The physics of the spacecraft is taken care of by the Lunar Lander Environment, and the agent uses a physics based approach to control the landing. My partner and I explored whether we could use Reinforcement Learning, specifically Q-Learning and SARSA, in order to match or better the performance of the heuristic lander. Because we had a continuous state space, which are not suited for Q-Learning and SARSA, we had to discretize our space. This caused the model to be able to learn and land, but it still could not beat the heuristic. The use of deep reinforcement learning would probably alleviate this issue, as this is suited for continuous state spaces. For all the details, please see the project report.
